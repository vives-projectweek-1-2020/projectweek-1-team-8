# Projectweek-1-team-8
 
## Goal
Make an app/website to track how many people are in or near a particular shop at a time. So people can wait at home until the shop has less visitors. This prevents long queues and a potential spread of the virus.

Three main goals:
- Track Who is in the shop.
- Track how many people are in the shop.
- Track how many cars are on the parking lot

important variables:
- Maximum allowed visitors
- Who has priority

## Technical details
Using detectors we can track how many people are in the shop at a given moment. This information is sent to a database where our app/website can access it.
