## Goal
Make an app/website to track how many people are in or near a particular shop at a time. So people can wait at home until the shop has less visitors. This prevents long queues and a potential spread of the virus.
We also want to use this technology to regulate the physical queue on the shop's parking itself. By digitalizing the queue, people can wait in their cars and don't need to be exposed to contact with other shoppers or heavy weather conditions.

## Technical details
Using detectors we can track how many people are in the shop at a given moment. This information is sent to a database where our app/website can access it.
With a (web) application, we can give users access to the queue. A digital column at the entrance can also show the current status.

Three main goals:
- Track who is in the shop
- Track how many people are in (and outside) the shop
- Control the queue with an automated system

important variables:
- Maximum allowed visitors
- Who has priority
