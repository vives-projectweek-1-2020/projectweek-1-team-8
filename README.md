 ## Goal
 make an app/website to track how many people are in a particular shop at a time. So people can wait at home until the shop has less visitors. This prevents long queues and a potential spread of the virus.

## Technical details
Using detectors we can track how many people are in the shop at a given moment. This information is sent to a database where our app/website can access it.
