## Goal
Make an app/website to track how many people are in or near a particular shop at a time. So people can wait at home until the shop has less visitors. This prevents long queues and a potential spread of the virus.

The shop accepts visitors until it has reached the maximum allowed visitors. the amount of visitors will be live updated on the app/website. If possible, there will be a display outside to 

## Technical details
Using detectors we can track how many people are in the shop at a given moment. This information is sent to a database where our app/website can access it.

Three main goals:
- Track Who is in the shop.
- Track how many people are in the shop. We can prevent too many people in the shop at once using this variable.
- Track how many cars are on the parking lot.

important variables:
- Maximum allowed visitors
- Who has priority
- How many times a person visited a shop (to derermine priority)
