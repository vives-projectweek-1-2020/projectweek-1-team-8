## Goal
Make an app/website to track how many people are in or near a particular company at a time. These can be self-employed or small professions (convenience store, doctor, pharmacist, ...).
People can wait at home until it is their turn in line. This prevents long queues and a potential spread of the virus.

The shop accepts visitors until it has reached the maximum allowed visitors (can be 1).
The amount of visitors will be live updated on the app/website. If possible, there will be a display outside too.
the business owner can control the flow in his business on the same app.

## Technical details
With a (web) application, we can give users access to the queue. A digital column at the entrance can also show the current status.

Three main goals:
- Track Who is in the shop.
- Track how many people are in the shop. We can prevent too many people in the shop at once using this variable.
- Track how many people are waiting outside or home.

some important variables:
- Maximum allowed visitors
- Who has priority
- How many times a person visited a shop (to derermine priority)
