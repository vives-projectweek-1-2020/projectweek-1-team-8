    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p id="firstp">Hi! We are 4 students of highschool Vives that develloped a brandnew app called Waitsmart.<br>
    Its a free app that will help people and bussinesses to prevent long queues. So loses the costumers <br>
    no time and its much safer because you don't get close to other people. </p>
    <p> <b>How does it work?</b> With a few clicks in our app can you select a bussiness or even multiple bussinesses <br>
    with a date and time you want. Our app will make sure that the bussiness get the reservation, if there are  <br>
    costumers before you then there will be a digital queue. On the app that gives you always the realtime <br>
    information of the queue you will see which place you're currently at. </p>
